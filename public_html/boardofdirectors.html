                  <h3>David Leckie (Build Committee Chair)</h3>
                  David has been a Director on the Habitat for Humanity London Board of Directors since 2006 and presently chairs the Build

                  <h3>Catherine McInerney</h3>
                  <img alt="" src="images/boardofdirectors_cmcinerney.jpg" style="float:right;width:120px;height:90px;margin:10px;">

                  <h3>Linda Armstrong (Family Selection &amp; Support Committee Chair)</h3>
                  Linda Armstrong was born and raised on a farm near Paris, Ontario.
                  She graduated in 1977 from The University of Waterloo with a degree in Psychology. 
                  After 30 years in business, she is now retired and travels extensively with her husband
                  Paul to feed their keen interest in nature, the environment, 
                  and the amazing variety of cultures in the world. 
                  Linda is also an avid golfer and gardener, continuing to learn and enjoy both.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Linda Armstrong would say that her personality was most shaped by life growing 
                  up on the farm. Her love of nature, work ethic, family values, and a 
                  roll-up-the-sleeves, pragmatic style, all were founded during those early days. 
                  Linda also credits her childhood experiences with teaching her to look for ways 
                  to do things more efficiently, thus her interest in driving change and process 
                  improvement throughout her business career.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Linda Armstrong was an influential senior leader in the telecommunications world 
                  for almost 30 years. She started with Bell as a part-time clerk while in her 
                  final year at University. She credits the coaching and encouragement of some 
                  terrific bosses, and the opportunity to progress through a wide variety of 
                  functions with keeping her motivated and engaged for more than 20 years. 
                  She particularly enjoyed working with teams in implementing many major 
                  projects and driving strategic change. After Bell, she led the Canadian 
                  Operations at Expertech, a national engineering and construction company, 
                  and then took on the role of Vice President National Network Assurance, 
                  working with a terrific team at Telus. Most recently, she worked with 
                  Ingram Micro Canada, the largest global distributor of consumer and 
                  business electronics, to develop logistics and warehousing solutions 
                  for a new target market.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  A diagnosis of breast cancer in late 2005 became a turning point in her life.
                  Linda decided to leave corporate life, and looked to the community for a way 
                  to give back. She was inspired by the work of Habitat for Humanity - finding a 
                  good fit with the pragmatic, action-oriented approach to solving a need, and 
                  the team-oriented model of an entire community helping a deserving family 
                  accomplish their goals. For the past 2 years she's been working with the 
                  Family Selection and Support committee with a focus on bringing process 
                  efficiencies and supporting families' success with meaningful education programs.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  
                  <h3>Luke Atkins</h3>
                  Luke is currently a self-employed entrepreneur.
                  He received his BA in Economics and BSc in Computer Science at the University of Western Ontario.
                  Over many years he has developed experience in the banking, health care, and utilities sectors.
                  He also has extensive background in IT project management and web software architectures.

                  As a fourth generation Londoner, 
                  Ethan left the city for education and work, only to return to London approximately 
                  ten years later hoping to make a difference in his hometown.  
                  With stops at Carleton and Ryerson Universities, as well as two years spent 
                  in British Columbia, Ethan brings a lot of different experiences to the table.
                  
                  Ethan worked as a Project Manager for a prestigious Custom Homebuilder in 
                  Toronto for three years, as a Development Planner in the private sector 
                  for three years and as a Municipal Planner with the City of London for three years.  
                  Ethan also has experience working in finance at the University of Western Ontario 
                  and as an outreach coordinator with a local environmental 
                  stewardship group <em>Friends of the Coves</em>.
                  
                  Ethan is new to the Habitat for Humanity London Board of Directors in 2009, 
                  but has been volunteering with the organization for several years.  
                  He looks forward to serving the community and furthering the vision of 
                  Habitat for Humanity through his new role on the board.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  
                  <h3>Paul Broadhead</h3>
                  Paul has lived in London and the immediate community for over 50 years.
                  He was educated at the University of Western Ontario, and belongs to a number of
                  financial and accounting related professions.

                  His passion? "I love to get up every morning and go for a run, it must be
                  the solitude... that explains why I don't like breakfast meetings."
