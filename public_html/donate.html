                  Habitat for Humanity's mission is to mobilize volunteers and community partners in 
                  building affordable housing and promoting homeownership as a means to breaking the 
                  cycle of poverty. We believe that access to safe, decent and affordable housing is 
                  a basic human right, which should be available to all.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Our gratitude goes out to the many volunteers and supporters who have already helped
                  us house 25 families in London. But there's still more work to be done if we are to
                  address the affordable housing crisis in our city.

                  or Community Relations Department at your place of employment.

                  another type of planned gift. If you believe in our mission to build affordable homes, a donation ensures that this commitment
                  continues beyond your lifetime. A donation to Habitat London could be the simplest and most valuable gift you make.

                  <h2>Building on Faith</h2><a name="faith"></a>
                  Habitat for Humanity London is a non-denominational, Christian housing organization that 
                  encourages diversity and cooperation among people of different religions and backgrounds. 
                  Members of churches, mosques and synagogues work together on our construction sites, and our 
                  homeowners are selected on need without regard to race or religion.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Habitat Founder, Millard Fuller, calls the concept "the theology of the hammer", explaining 
                  "we can all agree on the idea of building homes with God's people in need." 
                  Habitat for Humanity is a partnership founded on common ground, 
                  bridging theological differences by putting love into action.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Working with Habitat for Humanity London provides a tangible opportunity to live out you faith.
                  We have a variety of meaningful ways your congregation can put their faith into action.
                  Together we can make the dream of affordable housing a reality for low-income families in need.
                  
                  <p></p>
