                  <h3>What is Habitat for Humanity?</h3>
                  <img alt="" src="images/logo_icon1.jpg" style="margin:10px;float:right;width:54px;height:46px;">
                  Habitat for Humanity is an international, non-profit organization
                  working for a world where everyone has a safe and decent place to live.
                  Our mission is to mobilize volunteers and community partners in building
                  affordable housing and promoting homeownership as a means to breaking the
                  cycle of poverty.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  <a name="how"></a>
                  
                  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                  Through volunteer labour, efficient management and tax-deductible donations of money 
                  and materials, Habitat builds and rehabilitates simple, decent houses with the help 
                  of the homeowner (partner) families. Habitat houses are sold to partner families 
                  at no profit and financed with affordable, no-interest mortgages. 
                  The homeowners' monthly mortgage payments go into a revolving fund, which is 
                  used to build more houses.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="handup"></a>
                  
                  <h3>Why is Habitat "a hand up, not a hand out"?</h3>
                  Habitat houses are sold to families, not given to them free of charge.
                  <b>Habitat for Humanity is not a give-away program</b>. In addition to mortgage payments,
                  each homeowner invests hundreds of hours of their own labour, called "sweat equity",
                  into the building of their house and the houses of others.
                  
                  
                  <p></p>
                  By building homes at low cost, requiring very little or no down payment,
                  and not charging interest on the mortgage, Habitat for Humanity is able to
                  provide an opportunity, or a "hand up", to buy a home for families that would
                  not otherwise qualify for a conventional mortgage.
                  
                  <p></p>

                  <h3>What has Habitat for Humanity achieved?</h3>
                  Habitat for Humanity has built more than 225,000 homes in over 100 countries
                  around the world. A new home is dedicated worldwide every 21 minutes.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Habitat for Humanity Canada was founded in 1985, consists of over 35,000
                  volunteers and 72 affiliate organizations, and has dedicated more 
                  than 1,000 homes from coast to coast since its inception. 
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <div class="hr"></div>
                  
                  <a name="qualify"></a>
                  
                  <h3>Who qualifies for a home?</h3>
                  The three criteria to qualify for a Habitat home are 
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li>need for affordable housing,</li>
                     
                     <li>ability to repay a Habitat mortgage, and</li>
                     
                     <li>willingness to partner with Habitat.</li>
                     
                  </ol>
                  Need for affordable housing is defined by a family income that is below the government-set Low Income Cut-Off (poverty line)
                  for their particular region, and existing living conditions that are inadequate in terms of structure, cost, safety or size.
                  The ratio of shelter expense to total income is also factored.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Ability to repay a Habitat mortgage requires that the family has a stable income sufficient to cover the monthly mortgage
                  payments and other expenses that come with home ownership.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Homeowners must demonstrate a willingness to partner with Habitat by contributing 500 hours of volunteer labor ("sweat equity")
                  towards the building of their home.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <a name="choose"></a>
                  
                  <h3>How are families chosen?</h3>
                  Families are chosen on the basis of the above criteria. 
                  Family selection occurs at the local affiliate by way of an application process.
                  To obtain an application, contact your local Affiliate office.

                  <h3>What do families contribute?</h3>
                  In addition to mortgage payments, each homeowner invests hundreds of hours of
                  their time to assist in the building of their home. In return, Habitat homeowners
                  are given the unique opportunity to buy a home through an interest-free mortgage.
                  Thus, gaining substantial equity they would not have if renting.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  <a name="familyfinance"></a>
                  
                  <h3>What happens when family income changes?</h3>
                  The income of all Habitat homeowners is reviewed on an annual basis.
                  If income increases, monthly mortgage payments are adjusted to remain at 30% of
                  their monthly income. If income decreases, usually due to a temporary situation such
                  as a job loss, similar adjustments may be made to maintain affordability during
                  this period of decreased cash flow.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Habitat for Humanity is committed to educating and supporting partner families toward
                  successful homeownership. This commitment has resulted in a <b>1% mortgage default
                     rate</b> in Canada.

                  <h3>How do we acquire land?</h3>
                  Acquiring affordable land has been one of Habitat for Humanity's greatest challenges. 
                  Habitat seeks the assistance of governments at all levels in acquiring suitable 
                  donated or cost-reduced land. Habitat also relies on individual donors for land 
                  donations. In many cases we must purchase land.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  <a name="sale"></a>
                  
                  <h3>Can the family decide to sell their house at a profit, just months after taking possession?</h3>
                  The Habitat mortgage is designed to keep monthly payments low, encourage long-term
                  commitment and prevent short-term profit. This is done by way of a second mortgage.
                  The first mortgage reflects the actual cost of the house, which is usually far less
                  than it's fair market value. The second mortgage reflects the difference between
                  the actual cost and the fair market value. Upon full payment of the first mortgage,
                  the second mortgage is forgiven. The value of the second mortgage also decreases
                  gradually with time, usually beginning at the 12 year mark.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  If a family were to sell their house in the early years of their mortgage 
                  (within the first 12 years) the outstanding second mortgage would then be payable.

                  Here are some ways to help:
                  
                  <ul>

                     <li>Participate in Habitat fund-raising events.</li>
                     
                     <li>Get your company or your faith community involved.</li>
                     
                  </ul>

                  Habitat's vision with others. Materials may be ordered by mail, phone or fax.

                  <h3>What is Women Build?</h3>
                  <img alt="" src="images/womebbuild_logo1.gif" style="margin:5px;float:right;width:55px;height:63px;">
                  The Women Build Program promotes the involvement of women in the construction
                  of Habitat houses. Women-built projects provide an opportunity for women to
                  learn construction and to take on leadership roles in a supportive environment.
                  Women Build works through affiliates to nurture and train women to build
                  and invites women and men in the skilled trades to work with these women on the build.
                  The reward for skilled and unskilled women and men is personal satisfaction and
                  growth in providing a simple, decent, and affordable home with a family in need.
