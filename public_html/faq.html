                  <h3>What is Habitat for Humanity?</h3>
                  <img alt="" src="images/logo_icon1.jpg" style="margin:10px;float:right;width:54px;height:46px;">
                  Habitat for Humanity is an international, non-profit organization
                  working for a world where everyone has a safe and decent place to live.
                  Our mission is to mobilize volunteers and community partners in building
                  affordable housing and promoting homeownership as a means to breaking the
                  cycle of poverty.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  <a name="how"></a>
                  
                  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                  Through volunteer labour, efficient management and tax-deductible donations of money 
                  and materials, Habitat builds and rehabilitates simple, decent houses with the help 
                  of the homeowner (partner) families. Habitat houses are sold to partner families 
                  at no profit and financed with affordable, no-interest mortgages. 
                  The homeowners' monthly mortgage payments go into a revolving fund, which is 
                  used to build more houses.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="handup"></a>
                  
                  <h3>Why is Habitat "a hand up, not a hand out"?</h3>
                  Habitat houses are sold to families, not given to them free of charge.
                  <b>Habitat for Humanity is not a give-away program</b>. In addition to mortgage payments,
                  each homeowner invests hundreds of hours of their own labour, called "sweat equity",
                  into the building of their house and the houses of others.
                  
                  
                  <p></p>
                  By building homes at low cost, requiring very little or no down payment,
                  and not charging interest on the mortgage, Habitat for Humanity is able to
                  provide an opportunity, or a "hand up", to buy a home for families that would
                  not otherwise qualify for a conventional mortgage.
                  
                  <p></p>

                  <h3>What has Habitat for Humanity achieved?</h3>
                  Habitat for Humanity has built more than 225,000 homes in over 100 countries
                  around the world. A new home is dedicated worldwide every 21 minutes.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Habitat for Humanity Canada was founded in 1985, consists of over 35,000
                  volunteers and 72 affiliate organizations, and has dedicated more 
                  than 1,000 homes from coast to coast since its inception. 
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <div class="hr"></div>
                  
                  <a name="qualify"></a>
                  
                  <h3>Who qualifies for a home?</h3>
                  The three criteria to qualify for a Habitat home are 
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li>need for affordable housing,</li>
                     
                     <li>ability to repay a Habitat mortgage, and</li>
                     
                     <li>willingness to partner with Habitat.</li>
                     
                  </ol>
                  Need for affordable housing is defined by a family income that is below the government-set Low Income Cut-Off (poverty line)
                  for their particular region, and existing living conditions that are inadequate in terms of structure, cost, safety or size.
                  The ratio of shelter expense to total income is also factored.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Ability to repay a Habitat mortgage requires that the family has a stable income sufficient to cover the monthly mortgage
                  payments and other expenses that come with home ownership.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Homeowners must demonstrate a willingness to partner with Habitat by contributing 500 hours of volunteer labor ("sweat equity")
                  towards the building of their home.
                  
                  <p></p>

                  <h3>How are families chosen?</h3>
                  Families are chosen on the basis of the above criteria.

                  <h3>What do families contribute?</h3>
                  In addition to mortgage payments, each homeowner invests hundreds of hours of
                  their time to assist in the building of their home. In return, Habitat homeowners
                  are given the unique opportunity to buy a home through an interest-free mortgage.
                  Thus, gaining substantial equity they would not have if renting.

                  <h3>What happens when family income changes?</h3>
                  The income of all Habitat homeowners is reviewed on an annual basis.
                  If income increases, monthly mortgage payments are adjusted to remain at 30% of
                  their monthly income. If income decreases, usually due to a temporary situation such
                  as a job loss, similar adjustments may be made to maintain affordability during
                  this period of decreased cash flow.

                  Habitat for Humanity is committed to educating and supporting partner families toward
                  successful homeownership. This commitment has resulted in a <b>1% mortgage default
                     rate</b> in Canada.

                  <h3>How do we acquire land?</h3>
                  Acquiring affordable land has been one of Habitat for Humanity's greatest challenges. 
                  Habitat seeks the assistance of governments at all levels in acquiring suitable 
                  donated or cost-reduced land. Habitat also relies on individual donors for land 
                  donations. In many cases we must purchase land.

                  <a name="sale"></a>
                  
                  <h3>Can the family decide to sell their house at a profit, just months after taking possession?</h3>
                  The Habitat mortgage is designed to keep monthly payments low, encourage long-term
                  commitment and prevent short-term profit. This is done by way of a second mortgage.
                  The first mortgage reflects the actual cost of the house, which is usually far less
                  than it's fair market value. The second mortgage reflects the difference between
                  the actual cost and the fair market value. Upon full payment of the first mortgage,
                  the second mortgage is forgiven. The value of the second mortgage also decreases
                  gradually with time, usually beginning at the 12 year mark.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  If a family were to sell their house in the early years of their mortgage 
                  (within the first 12 years) the outstanding second mortgage would then be payable.
                  
                  <p></p>
                  Habitat for Humanity has the right to purchase the property if the homeowner wants
                  to sell.

                  Volunteers must be 18 years of age and older.
                  You may also volunteer if you are 16 or 17 years of age, but 
                  <em>only if you are accompanied by an adult</em>.

                  <h3>Do I need construction experience?</h3>
                  No. Most of our first-time volunteers do not have any experience.  
                  Come prepared to learn new skills and make new friends.

                  <h3>What do non-construction volunteers do at the build site?</h3>
                  Plenty of things. We need volunteers to help with early morning
                  registration and the serving of food and beverages during our breaks and lunch hour.  Towards the end of the build you could
                  find yourself sorting nails, emptying aprons etc.  We like to keep a tidy site.

                  When there is an upcoming build, our <a href="index.html">main home page</a> will contain
                  dates and a map to the current build site.

                  <h3>Do I have to pay to be volunteer?</h3>
                  Because we provide food/supplies for each individual, build site volunteers must pay a registration fee of $25 per person.
                  This fee covers supplies such as bandages, souvenir T-shirts, and any lunch/snacks that were
                  not donated by community groups for the day.

                  <h3>What else can I do to help?</h3>
                  Besides volunteers, what we need most is donations to help purchase building materials.
                  Here are some ways to help:
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Make a tax-deductible <a href="donate.html">donation</a> to Habitat for Humanity London Inc.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>Participate in Habitat fund-raising events.</li>

                  </ul>
                  
                  A wide variety of books, videos and literature are available to help you share

                  Community groups have always been vital to our mission.  
                  In the past, they have provided lunch and snacks for our hard-working 
                  build site volunteers.  We could not do this without them.

                  <img alt="" src="images/womebbuild_logo1.gif" style="margin:5px;float:right;width:55px;height:63px;">
                  The Women Build Program promotes the involvement of women in the construction
                  of Habitat houses. Women-built projects provide an opportunity for women to
                  learn construction and to take on leadership roles in a supportive environment.
                  Women Build works through affiliates to nurture and train women to build
                  and invites women and men in the skilled trades to work with these women on the build.
                  The reward for skilled and unskilled women and men is personal satisfaction and
                  growth in providing a simple, decent, and affordable home with a family in need.

                  Bring an enthusiastic attitude! We provide sunscreen.
                  You may wish to bring your own if your skin is extremely sensitive.
                  If you have allergies, please bring your medication.
                  Do not bring valuables, as we do not have storage lockers for purses and wallets.
                  Water bottles are handy because we provide a water dispenser to fill your bottle. 
                  Please put your name on any items you bring.

                  <h3>Should I bring my own lunch?</h3>
                  Most lunch, snacks and beverages are generously provided by local community groups and churches.
                  If you require a special diet, you may want to pack your own lunch.
                  If you have specific food allergies, please notify us ahead of time
                  and considering packing a few backup items in case there is cross contamination.

                  <h3>What should I wear? Do I need steel-toe boots?</h3>
                  We recommend wearing long sleeved shirts if your skin is sensitive to the sun.  
                  Long pants will prevent scrapes and scratches to your legs.  
                  A hat is a good idea if you are working in the sun.  
                  Towards the fall, you may want to dress in layers as the mornings can be chilly, 
                  but the afternoons can still be hot.  
                  Our online safety video will provide more details on recommended clothing. 
                  Please bring your own work gloves.  
                  We have a very limited amount of steel toed boots in a variety of sizes that 
                  you can borrow for the day, based on a first come-first serve basis.  
                  <b>Safety boots and/or shoes are a mandatory part of build site attire.  </b>
                  We will lend the use of hard hats, aprons, hammers, protective eyewear, masks and earplugs.

                  <h3>Can I get transportation to the build site?</h3>
                  Volunteers must find their own transportation to and from the site.
                  We do our best to ensure that the houses we build have
                  access to bus routes and services.

                  <h3>Is there parking near the site?</h3>
                  The answer to this question varies with each site location.
                  We attempt to be mindful of the residents in the area we are building,
                  and do our best to find a parking area that will not take over their street.
                  Once a designated parking area is found, we will let our volunteers
                  know and provide a map if necessary.

                  <h3>When I arrive, who do I report to?</h3>
                  When you arrive on the build site, look for a table with a large <em>registration</em>
                  sign.  Bring your completed waiver to this table and check in.
                  If you do not bring your waiver, you will be asked to fill one
                  out prior to beginning your work day.  Each person must check in upon
                  arrival and check out when they leave for safety purposes.  If you do not
                  have steel-toe boots, we will do our best to accommodate you with safety
                  footwear on a first come first serve basis.
                  Next you will be provided with a tool apron and hard hat and any other
                  necessary safety equipment required for the day.  You will be asked to
                  write your name on masking tape and affix it to the front of your hard hat.

                  Volunteers who have been accepted to work on the build site will be
                  asked to view an online safety training video before participating in the build.
                  Every morning highlights of this safety video will be mentioned before the group
                  breaks up into teams.  All volunteers, contractors and staff are expected to
                  comply with safety procedures while on the site.
                  Certified safety footwear and hard hats are mandatory.

                  It is an asset for a volunteer to have current First Aid and CPR certifications
                  when they come to the build site.
                  Some of our staff, contractors and volunteers on the site will have this training.
                  On exceptionally busy days, Habitat For Humanity London Inc. will pay St. John's
                  Ambulance to be on the build site for the day.

                  Volunteers need to fill out a registration form.
                  Everyone (volunteers and contractors) will be required to fill out and sign a waiver.
                  The waiver includes a space to provide emergency contact information.
                  Please come prepared to complete this section.
                  In addition to liability, the waiver covers the release of any photographs taken
                  for media and publicity purposes.
                  Build site waivers are good for one year.  If you are a returning volunteer, you will be required to sign another waiver.

                  <h3>On which days of the week do you build?</h3>
                  Our build site is typically active Tuesday through Saturday.
                  Mondays are reserved for skilled tradespeople only.
                  The first two weeks may include Sundays as well,
                  depending on the size of the build project.

                  <h3>Do you build in bad weather?</h3>
                  Weather is evaluated on an individual, daily basis.
                  Extreme rain, wind or heat may be cause to shorten or even cancel a day on the build site.
                  If we need to cancel a volunteer day on the build site, we will do our best
                  to accommodate you on another day, including the possibility of adding
                  a Sunday volunteer shift.
                  We will post notifications on our web page, our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Habitat-For-Humanity/566105982">Facebook</a> page and our <a href="http://twitter.com/HabitatLondonON">Twitter</a> feed.

                  <h3>Do you build homes in the winter?</h3>
                  Volunteers typically work with us for 6-8 weeks starting in August.
                  If it takes extra time to secure land the build may start slightly later, in the Fall.
                  For safety and comfort reasons, we do not build in the winter months.

                  <h3>What if I have physical limitations, like asthma?</h3>
                  If you have a physical limitation such as asthma, or allergy of any kind, 
                  it is important that you notify us prior to attending the build site 
                  (preferably during the registration phase).  
                  Seasonal allergies, an allergy to latex, peanuts, insulation, wood chips, 
                  dust, wasps, paint fumes etc will reflect when and where you can be scheduled 
                  during the construction process.  
                  We also need to ensure that your emergency contact information is current 
                  (for example - they are not away on summer vacation).  
                  Please ensure you bring your inhalers, epee pens, with you on your 
                  scheduled shift and let your Crew Leader and team know of your allergy, 
                  what to do in an emergency, and the location of these items needed for treatment.
