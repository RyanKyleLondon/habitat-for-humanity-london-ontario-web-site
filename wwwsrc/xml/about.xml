    <h2>About Habitat for Humanity London</h2>

    Habitat for Humanity London was established in 1993. 
    We are a non-profit, non-denominational Christian housing organization. 
    We welcome partners without discrimination to help us build simple, 
    decent, affordable homes with low-income families. 
    Habitat London funds 100% of all administrative costs through the 
    operation of our ReStore. To date, Habitat London has built 24 homes and 
    has just completed renovating its first home. We believe that by offering 
    a family a hand up, not a hand-out, we empower low-income families to become 
    successful homeowners.  
    <p></p>    
    Habitat London is an affiliate of <a href="http://habitat.ca/">Habitat for 
    Humanity Canada</a>, who works with corporate, individual and faith-based 
    donors and volunteers to help low-income families realize a more stable 
    future through our home ownership program.
    We help families who
    <ul>
      <li>can demonstrate a need for affordable housing,</li>
      <li>are willing to partner with us and volunteer 500 hours of "sweat equity", and</li>
      <li>have the ability to repay an interest-free mortgage over an average of 25 years.</li>
    </ul>
    Mortgage revenues go directly into a revolving house building fund to continue building yet more Habitat homes.
