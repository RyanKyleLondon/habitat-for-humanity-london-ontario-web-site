    <h3>Connie Graham (Board Chair)</h3>
    <img alt="" src="images/boardofdirectors_cgraham.jpg" style="float:right;width:100px;height:145px;margin:10px;"/>
    Connie felt compelled to join the Habitat for Humanity mission in 2006,
    and served as Vice-Chair until being elected to the Chair in 2007.
    She quickly realized her passion was to help Habitat London increase
    its optimum build capacity in order to help address London's rapidly growing
    need for safe, affordable housing.
    <p></p>
    Connie graduated with a Bachelor Science degree in 1978, and spent her working
    career developing management-level competencies in sales, marketing and strategic
    planning with well-known corporations such as General Electric and IBM.
    <p></p>
    Since relocating to London in 2003, Connie has put her skills to work in
    a large variety of community service projects;  directing the funding
    and development of community recreation facilities for a local Optimist Club,
    designing and funding a community branding and development strategy for Port Franks,
    Ontario, and providing a variety of consultancy services for municipal government projects.
    Connie has quietly served many organizations through a strategic planning and
    consulting service she has sponsored since 1996.  She is also currently serving
    on the Boys and Girls Club of London Foundation Board as Fundraising Chair.

    <img alt="" src="images/boardofdirectors_larmstrong.jpg" style="float:right;width:100px;height:159px;margin:10px;"/>
    Linda left corporate life in 2005 after a diagnosis of breast cancer became
    a turning point in her life. She was inspired by the work of Habitat for
    Humanity -- finding a good fit with the pragmatic, action-oriented approach
    to solving a need, and the team-oriented model of an entire community
    helping a deserving family accomplish their goals. Since 2007, she's been
    working with the HFHL Family Selection and Support committee with a focus on
    bringing process efficiencies and supporting families' success with
    meaningful education programs. She now chairs that vibrant and active
    sub-committee.
    <p></p>
    Linda's career in the telecommunications/technology field spanned almost 30
    years. She credits the coaching and encouragement of some terrific bosses,
    and the opportunity to progress through a wide variety of functions with
    honing her business skills and motivating her to continually seek new
    learnings and experiences.  Her career included progressive senior and
    executive positions with Bell, Expertech, Telus and Ingram Micro. She thinks
    of herself as an "operations" person and remembers fondly working with
    terrific team members in implementing big projects and major changes in
    those organizations.
    <p></p>
    Linda's passions are nature, travel, golf and gardens. She and her husband
    Paul, a photographer, enjoy traveling and learning more about this wonderful
    world, the environment and the always amazing and interesting people.
